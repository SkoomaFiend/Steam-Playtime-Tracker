# üïπÔ∏è Steam Playtime Tracker

Shell scripts to track and summarize playtime for any game, including non-Steam games launched with Proton, using Steam‚Äôs Launch Options.



# üìÅ Files

    playtime.sh
  Tracks how long a specified process runs, and logs playtime per session.

    sum_playtime.sh
  Summarizes total playtime for all logged games and writes the results to summary.log.

    summary.log 
  Contains each games total playtime as was well as the total for all games.


# üîß Setup

Place both scripts somewhere executable, e.g.:

    mkdir -p ~/scripts
    cp playtime.sh sum_playtime.sh ~/scripts/
    chmod +x ~/scripts/*.sh

Ensure logs are saved to:

    ~/.local/share/game-playtime/

# üïπÔ∏è Tracking a Game

In Steam, add a game or edit a non-Steam game's Launch Options:

    /home/youruser/scripts/playtime.sh "Game Name" "Process Name" & %command%

Replace "Game Name" with a name you want in the log (e.g. Risk of Rain 2)

Replace "Process Name" with the actual process to track (e.g. RoR2.x86_64 or proton)

    %command% ensures Steam launches the game after starting the tracker

# üìä Summarizing Playtime

Run the summary script to total up playtime per game:

    ~/scripts/sum_playtime.sh

This creates:

    ~/.local/share/game-playtime/summary.log

Sample contents:

    Risk of Rain 2               1h 42m 11s
    Dark Souls III               3h 10m  7s

    TOTAL                        4h 52m 18s

# üí° Tips

You can reuse playtime.sh for each game by customizing the Launch Options

Works great with Proton-based games or any Linux binary

Put sum_playtime.sh into your global scripts directory or add an alias to run it 

Add alias to easily show game playtime log : 

    bat ~/.local/share/game-playtime/summary.log
